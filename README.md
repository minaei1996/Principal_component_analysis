# Principal_component_analysis
I wrote some code that uses pca to reduce the dimensionality of the "pca dataset" from Kaggle.
----------------------
The Principal Component Analysis approach is used in this project to reduce the number of dimensions in the data "pca dataset," which you may get here:

----------------------
using my code, the number of features reduced to 7 from 18. and the total error of calculations where less than 0.01.
the codes ouputs are z: reduced dimention data.
                     error: cost of reduction.
                     i: count of new features.
